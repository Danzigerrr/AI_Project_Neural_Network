The vaccines, offered to the U.S. population, have proved to be 90 percent effective against infection. Ready within a year of the outbreak, they have proved to be safe. And they are widely available and free. There is no parallel in modern times. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 eligible Americans have yet to get their first vaccine dose. Millions of people remain unvaccinated. They were 14 times more likely than the vaccinated to die of covid, as of December, the latest month for which data is available. How many of the 551,168 covid deaths in the United States since Jan. 1, 2021, could have been averted with vaccines? Too many. No more powerful case can be made than the voices of those who hesitated to get vaccinated and then faced the awful consequences."

Within days, mRNA coronavirus vaccines were being widely acknowledged as one of our best bets against the virus. Scientists started using the technology to develop shots — on a breathtakingly rapid timeline. Suddenly, it seemed, everyone wanted to know who was responsible for this promising technique. If Malone is right about one thing pertaining to the mRNA vaccines, Geall said, it's that it is still important to keep researching these products and answering any yet unanswered questions about them, in addition to improving how and when they're used. \"Would I have preferred that there had been 15 years of research and safety generation through clinical trials? Absolutely,\" Geall said. \"But that wasn't an option during the pandemic.\" So he, and all the other scientists interviewed for this article, got vaccinated with the mRNA vaccines that they, Malone, and many others helped create over a 30-year period."

The response may be similar whether that first encounter is from infection with the virus or from the first dose of the vaccine. Studies of the mRNA vaccines suggest that one dose may offer between 50 to 80 percent protection against symptomatic COVID-19, though more data is needed, said Boslett. “We know you get some amount of protection after one dose of the vaccine or after infection with the virus, but we don’t know in either case how long that protection lasts,” she said. Some cases of reinfection have been reported after three to six months, so the protection from one dose of the vaccine also may wane in that timeframe. “However, when you get the second dose of the vaccine, you’re further training your immune system,” said Boslett. “You’re strengthening that response from the antibody-producing B cells and you’re also activating T memory cells that stick around for much longer.” Getting both doses of the vaccine means your body is shown this spike protein multiple times in a short duration. “So that immune response might be bigger, better and longer lasting than just getting the infection one time,” she said. Because the booster effect is so important, Boslett adds that this is why people who have had COVID-19 are still recommended to get the vaccine. "

The COVID-19 vaccine trials have moved along faster thanks to extra financial support from the government and other funding sources, and the high prevalence of the virus in the community, said Boslett. “They didn’t skip any steps.” More than 40,000 people were enrolled in the Pfizer vaccine trials, and more than 30,000 in the Moderna vaccine trials. “That’s a lot of people, but if the virus were rare, that still wouldn’t be enough people,” said Boslett. “But because the virus is running so rampant throughout the U.S. and other places in the world, this was actually a good number of people to show a difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.” The mRNA technology, which has undergone years of study for other potential vaccines, was another time-saver.

Once the study is complete, the numbers of sick people in each group are compared, in order to calculate the relative risk of getting sick depending on whether or not the subjects received the vaccine. From this we get the efficacy – a measure of how much the vaccine lowered the risk of getting sick. If a vaccine has high efficacy, a lot fewer people in the group who received the vaccine got sick than the people in the group who received the placebo. So, for example, let’s imagine a vaccine with a proven efficacy of 80%. This means that – out of the people in the clinical trial – those who received the vaccine were at a 80% lower risk of developing disease  than the group who received the placebo. This is calculated by comparing the number of cases of disease in the vaccinated group versus the placebo group. An efficacy of 80% does not mean that 20% of the vaccinated group will become ill."

Many epidemiological vaccine safety studies make the basic mistake of declaring \"lack of association\" because the confidence interval of the odds ratio does not span the null value.

    "text": "Since the Covid-19 vaccines have been released under the emergency use authorization act (EUA) as an experimental, and mostly untested, set of vaccines, we have seen a dramatic rise in reported deaths and serious injuries caused by these “vaccines”. In fact, since VAERS data was first released, deaths caused by the vaccines have increased by almost 1,000 deaths per month. The last figures, as of June 25th, 2021 recorded 9,049 Covid vaccine-related deaths, which is an increase of 2,000 deaths in just one week. This indicates that there has been a dramatic acceleration in vaccine-related deaths. Prior to these vaccines, deaths from all vaccines combined, per year were around 350 people. Despite the mass, unprecedented number of vaccine-related deaths, the program continued unabated. During this same period, 34,065 serious complications have also been reported secondary to these vaccines, up 2,825 cases within the previous week. VAERS reports that 5,852 of these people are permanently damaged. Over 54,551 people suffered such a significant reaction to the vaccines that they ended up in the emergency room. Of the injuries 6,898 were considered life threatening. If we even use a very low figure of underreporting of 10% (rather than the 99% true figure) that would mean we actually have 90,000 deaths and 340,000 serious injuries, 58,852 of whom are permanently injured. Steve Kirsch, a researcher, stated in a position paper that his examination, confirmed by three studies, concluded that possibly 25,800 Americans have died as a result of the vaccines. Because of poor record keeping, we just don’t have an accurate number yet."

However, the unvaccinated makeup only 27 percent of the caseload, 25 percent of hospitalizations, and roughly 10 percent of the deaths in England now. The United Kingdom is officially living in a pandemic of the “fully vaccinated.” To make matters worse, deaths continue to surge for populations that are triply vaccinated, proving that the third shot is not an immune booster in the slightest. This third shot is just another inflammatory dose of spike proteins – a game of Russian roulette that causes more blood clots and heart inflammation, leading to further immune system depletion, sickness and death. While the Week 8 report paints a harrowing picture of vaccine failure, vaccine damage and propaganda exposed, the report also states, “this raw data should not be used to estimate vaccine effectiveness.” In other words, the raw data should be ignored and the covid-19 vaccination narrative should still be blindly and arrogantly believed. According to the data, roughly 400,000 unvaccinated people tested positive for covid-19 and over one million VACCINATED people tested positive. A total of 752,126 of these cases were recorded in triply vaccinated individuals. This data is shocking because the unvaccinated are the ones who are typically coerced to take covid-19 PCR tests as a prerequisite to interact with the public. If the unvaccinated want to partake in certain public events and travel, they are more likely to be contact traced and forcibly swabbed as if they have no freedom or due process rights."

However, there were 6,889 hospitalizations for the vaccinated (a number that is rapidly increasing). Most of these hospitalizations are occurring in triply vaccinated individuals (4,936). In all, 75 percent of all Covid-19 hospitalizations are observed in the vaccinated. When it comes to fatalities, the unvaccinated cohort is improving. The unvaccinated accounted for 559 deaths in the last reporting period and the vaccinated accounted for 4,302 deaths, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the triply vaccinated (3,120). The vaccinated population now accounts for 90 percent of the deaths overall. The triply vaccinated account for 4 of every 5 of these fatalities! To put these figures in perspective, take a look at the Week 51 Vaccine Surveillance Report for 2021. From November 22 to December 19, 2021, there were 889 unvaccinated deaths and 2,913 vaccinated deaths. This shows that the fatality rate for the unvaccinated population is going down, while the fatality rate for the vaccinated population is getting severely worse.

It’s entitled, “Intracellular Reverse Transcription of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 In Vitro in Human Liver Cell Line.” The study concludes that, “BNT162b2 mRNA is reverse transcribed intracellularly into DNA as fast as 6 [hours] after BNT162b2 exposure.” This means the vaccine alters your genetic code in mere hours after being injected. This may help explain why cancer rates are exploding in people who take covid vaccines. The integrity of their DNA is being destroyed. It is also yet more proof that the mRNA particles from the vaccine do, indeed, circulate throughout the body and don’t stay restricted to the injection site. That’s another lie told to the world by the CDC, Big Tech and the pharma-funded corporate media which has been caught in lie after lie when it comes to covid origins and vaccine safety."

In 2020, Zelenko gained the attention of then-president Donald Trump with his simple protocol against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) using cheap, proven and widely available drugs that include hydroxychloroquine. He was able to successfully treat more than 350 patients with only one requiring hospitalization. His approach is to identify high-risk COVID patients and start treatment immediately. However, so-called public health experts were not convinced and questioned Zelenko’s protocol. Two years later, amidst the continued suppression of early treatments, Zelenko talked about a newly discovered adverse effect of COVID-19 vaccines: the vaccine-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or VAIDS. (Related: As covid injections spread autoimmune disease and “VAIDS,” media pivots to incoming AIDS “vaccine” that will only accelerate the vaccine genocide.) He shared that Israel, one of the most vaccinated countries in the world, may have put its citizens in danger. “There are 30 peer-reviewed papers that I know of that have documented how these vaccines destroy your innate immune system.

This report from VAERS, according to Ruby, was filed by the mom. The mother also said in the entry that her baby became very sick with a high fever about two weeks after she got her first COVID jab.

For example, phase three of the trial – when tens of thousands of trial participants were given the jab – commenced when phase two – which saw hundreds receiving the vaccine – was still ongoing. At a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday, Dr June Raine – the head of the UK’s regulatory agency which has given the Pfizer treatment the thumbs up – said no corners have been cut. “If you’re climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became available on 10 November we were at base camp,” she said. “And then when we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us to today.” Vaccine trials are usually held up by long periods of inertia – waiting for funding, resources and permissions to come through. But, because of the huge global stake in ending the pandemic, there was no waiting game.  A huge amount of funding and support were poured into vaccine efforts across the world – and that’s brought us to where we are today. As for side effects, they usually show up in trials quickly after vaccination – while longer-term effects are very rare. So you don’t have anything to worry about on that front, either."

Millions have gotten the jab and according to the govt. we were supposed to be going back to normal if we complied. That didn’t happen. When do our doctors get to practice their profession and treat us with symptoms before we have to go to the hospital? I don’t want to be told to go home and come back when I can’t breathe.

I evaluate several previously undertheorised premises implicit to the ‘obligation to vaccinate’ type of arguments and show that the general conclusion is false: there is neither a moral obligation to vaccinate nor a sound ethical basis to mandate vaccination under any circumstances, even for hypothetical vaccines that are medically risk-free. Agent autonomy with respect to self-constitution has absolute normative priority over reduction or elimination of the associated risks to life. In practical terms, mandatory vaccination amounts to discrimination against healthy, innate biological characteristics, which goes against the established ethical norms and is also defeasible a priori."

    "text": "However, there has been a recent rise in anti-vaccination sentiments surrounding beliefs that vaccines cause more harm than benefits to the health of the children who receive them. The premise of the anti-vaccination movement can also be contributed to the demonization of vaccinations by news and entertainment outlets. Voices such as Jenny McCarthy’s have proven to be influential, sweeping fear and distrust into parents’ minds by parading as “autism experts”. Social media and television talk show hosts, such as Oprah Winfrey, played a big role in this miseducation by giving credence to the campaign. This has caused vaccination rates to sustain a surprising drop in some Western countries [2]. The decrease in vaccinations has led to recent outbreaks of diseases that were thought to be “eliminated”, such as measles. Still, other reasons for the anti-vaccination movement can be due to personal reasons, such as religious or secular views. A drop in immunizations poses a threat to the herd immunity the medical world has worked hard to achieve. Global communities are now more connected than ever, which translates to a higher probability of the transmission of pathogens. The only thing that can protect populations against a rapidly spreading disease is the disease's resistance created by herd immunity when the majority are immune after vaccinations. Given the highly contagious nature of diseases like measles, vaccination rates of 96% to 99% are necessary to preserve herd immunity and prevent future outbreaks [3]."

Eminent independent scientists and researchers in the fields of immunology and microbiology have been writing to medical regulators since early 2021 [3], warning of vaccine-related blood clotting and bleeding, including that the official data on blood abnormalities post-vaccination likely represent “just the tip of a huge iceberg” [4]. Those scientists’ warnings pre-dated vaccine suspensions around the world due to acute disease from aberrant blood clotting post-vaccination. The warnings were based on established immunological science, applied to the novel mechanism of action of the gene-based COVID- 19 vaccines. Now, more than six months later, new discoveries in the immunology of SARS-CoV-2 [5] have caught up with the rushed vaccination schedule, confirming and extending the experts’ prior warnings. The good news is that we are more comprehensively protected against COVID-19 by our own pre-existing immunity than was previously understood. On the other hand, this pre-existing immunity aggravates the risk that COVID-19 vaccines will induce blood clotting and/or leaky blood vessels. This risk must be expected to escalate with each revaccination. Vaccine-induced harm to our blood vessels is unlikely to be rare."

This can bring about the destruction of any cell that manufactures the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, particularly in the circulation. If that happens to the endothelia, that is, the cell layer that lines the inner surfaces of our blood vessels, then those vessels may begin to leak [6] and clots will form. Given that 2021 research showed the spike protein to enter the bloodstream shortly after vaccination [5], this dangerous endothelial involvement in spike-production is highly likely, and should be expected to occur. As stark as these medical realities may be, the silver lining is that the same antibody profile, along with previously documented T-cell immunity [7–11], protects around 99% of the population against life- threatening SARS-CoV-2 infections. This ties in with the known fact that over 99% of people are safe from death with COVID-19 [12–14]."

An important consideration for patients is that those who have already been vaccinated against COVID- 19, and whose health remains intact, can protect themselves against serious harm by stopping now. For a detailed explanation of the science behind these vaccine-immune interactions, please read Part II. Implications for doctors and patients are considered in Part III. In Full: Explanation of New Findings on the Immunology of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 Vaccines 2.1. How and why COVID-19 vaccines incite immunological attack on blood vessel walls. What is wrong with booster shots? Until recently, the immune profile of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines was not fully characterised. While we have known since mid-2020 that robust and lasting memory T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 exists [7–11], the antibody picture has been less clear. Now, however, a convergence of evidence from peer reviewed studies published in 2021 reveals that pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 involves not only T-cells but also memory antibodies, in 99% of people studied. Two publications from 2020 alert to the probability that the immune response to the vaccine will also involve an important and powerful component called the complement system. This has profound consequences for the risk-benefit analysis of the vaccines."

    "text": "Importantly for COVID-19 vaccination, the 2021 discoveries reveal that the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 is not truly new to our immune systems. The finding that the overwhelming majority of people show a memory-type antibody profile to COVID-19 vaccines proves that our immune systems have seen viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 before. As a result, our bodies have stored an immune memory of that family of viruses, equipping us to fight back more rapidly and powerfully the next time we encounter a similar virus again. As SARS-Cov-2 is of the coronavirus family, this indicates that we possess lasting cross-immunity from previous exposure to other coronaviruses, such as common cold coronaviruses, which are in wide circulation globally. Simply put, almost anyone who is fundamentally healthy—or ‘immunocompetent’—is naturally sufficiently protected against COVID-19. This immunological status accords with the well-documented reality that the infection fatality rate for COVID-19 is 0.15-0.2% worldwide [12–14]. As is well known, COVID-19 infection runs a fatal course only in those who are weakened by age and significant comorbidity. Put differently, once infected, COVID-19 is non-lethal to >99.8% of the world’s population. This same figure is upwards of 99.9% in the young and middle-aged. These statistics reflect the fact that protective cross-immunity is the global norm."

    "text": "But what about the second and third waves of “cases”, including from Delta and other variants, around the world? It is important to understand that a COVID-19 “case”, as currently defined, does not correspond to being ill. To an unprecedented extent in medical history, rather than referring to actual disease, the term “case” has become conflated with nothing more than a positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result. While PCR tests are useful in laboratory research and as diagnostic tools when carefully performed, they are not reliable or appropriate when used in isolation, nor set at extremely high sensitivities, nor in poorly trained hands, as has been the case overwhelmingly for COVID-19. It has long been known that reliance on PCR tests alone to define medical “cases” and causes of death results in “overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and increased health care costs” [21]. If PCR alone were used to diagnose an infection with the diarrhoeal pathogen Clostridium difficile (CD), for instance, an epidemic of CD would immediately appear. We would find, based on PCR results, that 50% of people in long term care, and 15% of those hospitalised for any reason, are CD “cases” [22]. Should they die of any cause following a positive PCR test for CD, they would be recorded as “dying with” CD. That figure could conceivably approach 100% if PCR tests were performed at the high sensitivities, or cycle thresholds, routinely employed when testing for COVID-19, in which the sensitivity of the test has been dialled up to meaningless extremes [23]. Horeover, even if we accepted PCR alone as a diagnostically appropriate tool—and therefore the high number of “cases” that it generates—we would still necessarily infer a very low infection fatality rate for COVID-19. This supports rather than contradicts the reality that SARS-CoV-2 poses no significant threat to the immunocompetent. In short, thanks to population immunity, for the vast majority of us, a “case” does not equate to severe disease."

    "text": "While the now clearly established widespread cross-immunity against SARS-CoV-2 implies that most of us are safe from severe COVID-19 disease, it also means that we are vulnerable to the harms of gene- based vaccines. Due to recall immunity against the virus, vaccination will cause our immune systems to fight aggressively against not only the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but against ourselves. This deleterious autoimmune attack must be expected to intensify with each repeated injection. The COVID-19 vaccine technology’s interaction with the immune system creates the following four specific problems:      Flying under the immune system’s radar with the vaccine’s genetic code 2. Delivering the spike protein into the bloodstream     Inducing immune attack on the blood vessel lining Enhancing the severity of natural infection     2.4.1. Flying Under the Immune System’s Radar with the Vaccine’s Genetic Code     To understand why COVID-19 vaccine technology is dangerous, it is necessary to first understand how     the gene-based vaccines differ from traditional vaccination methods.     A conventional viral vaccine can be a live virus strain derived from the pathogenic virus that has been attenuated through one or more genetic mutations, or it can consist of chemically inactivated virus particles that are no longer able to infect any cells. In both cases, protein antigens will be exposed on the surface of the vaccine particles, which can be recognized by antibodies once these have been formed.     COVID-19 vaccines, on the other hand, are not protein antigens but the genetic blueprint for the SARS- CoV-2 spike protein antigen. That blueprint comes in the form of mRNA or DNA, which, after vaccination, enters our body’s cells and instructs those cells to manufacture the spike protein. The spike protein then protrudes from the cell and induces antibody formation. In response, the immune system will react not only with the spike protein, but will attack and try to destroy the entire cell.     If we are injected with a traditional live virus vaccine to which we have no immunity, then these vaccine virus particles will also infect some of our body cells and propagate within them. Two kinds of immune reactions will then occur:     Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (killer T-cells) (see section 2.4.3.1) that recognize viral protein fragments associated with the infected cells will proliferate, attack, and destroy the infected cells.     B-lymphocytes that recognize viral proteins (see section 2.4.3.2) will proliferate and start producing antibodies—soluble protein molecules that can recognize and neutralize virus particles."

    "text": "This immune reaction will in principle resemble that to an infection with the corresponding wild-type virus. It will be milder, since the vaccine strain of the virus has been attenuated; however, some cells will get destroyed in the process, which may sometimes cause functional organ damage. Live virus vaccines therefore tend to be more prone to adverse reactions than are inactivated virus vaccines. Now, a key point to note is that if we inject a live traditional vaccine into a person who is already immune —due to either a previous vaccination, or to prior infection with the corresponding wild-type virus—the extent of cell destruction will be much reduced. Such a person will already have antibodies to the virus; these will recognize the viral protein antigens and will bind and inactivate most of the vaccine virus particles before they manage to infect a cell. Therefore, even though the killer T-cells may be all riled up, they will not find very many infected cells to pounce on. The crucial difference between a conventional live virus vaccine and a gene-based COVID vaccine—and in particular an mRNA vaccine—is that the latter contains no protein antigens whatsoever; instead, it only contains the blueprint for their synthesis inside the infected cells. Therefore, if such a vaccine is injected into a person with antibodies and existing T-cell immunity, the vaccine particles will “fly under the radar” of the antibody defence and reach our body cells unimpeded. The cells will then produce the spike protein, and subsequently be destroyed and attacked by the killer T-cells. The antibodies, rather than preventing the carnage, will join in by also binding to the cell-associated spike protein and directing the complement system (see later) and other immune effector mechanisms against these cells. In a nutshell, pre-existing immunity mitigates the risk of conventional vaccines, but it amplifies the risk of gene-based vaccines. Importantly, before COVID, this risky gene-based vaccine technology had never before been used on a wide scale against infectious disease and is inherently experimental. The COVID-19 vaccination program is thus the largest human experiment ever performed in history."

Delivering the Spike Protein into the Bloodstream A dire danger of COVID-19 vaccines is that spike proteins produced by myriad endothelial cells, i.e. the innermost cells lining blood vessel walls, will be exported to the cell surface and protrude directly into the bloodstream. Moreover, a fraction of these spikes will be cleaved during their passage to the outside world. They will fall off the cells into the bloodstream and then bind to their receptors on other endothelial cells at distant sites. While at the outset of the vaccination campaign in 2020 it was unknown to what extent COVID vaccines entered the bloodstream, human data from 2021 reveal that the spike protein shows up within the circulation on the very day of the injection [15]. Similarly, animal studies submitted by Pfizer to the Japanese government [24] found that the vaccine appears in the circulation within 15 minutes of intramuscular injection, reaching maximum plasma concentration within just two hours. Very high levels have subsequently been recorded in the liver, the spleen, the adrenal glands, and the ovaries. Vaccine components have also been observed in the central nervous system (the brain and the spinal cord), albeit at lower concentrations. Such widespread distribution throughout the body via the bloodstream is a feat that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not usually achieve."

Open Questions in the Ongoing Experiment But how do COVID-19 vaccine particles enter the circulation in the first place? The vaccine is injected intramuscularly, and the vaccine particles are too large to passively diffuse across blood vessel walls. Most obviously, the vaccines will follow the conventional, relatively time-consuming path which takes them via the draining lymph nodes to the blood circulation. But additionally, two possibilities for very rapid entry  into the bloodstream should be heeded. The first is via direct uptake by vessels that are damaged during insertion of the needle. Secondly, it is possible that the vaccine particles undergo ‘transcytosis’, a process that enables large molecules to be transported across intact cell layers. Whatever the case may be, although Pfizer knew before the onset of clinical trials that their vaccine reached the bloodstream rapidly, either they failed to file these findings with medical regulators in Europe, the US and other Western countries, or the regulators failed to act upon the findings [25]. This is a critical oversight where patient safety is concerned. Given that the gene-based vaccines induce the body’s cells to become immune targets, where in the body this takes place is of critical concern. While immune-mediated cell death is never favourable, it is particularly detrimental and dangerous if it afflicts the blood vessel walls."

    "text": "2.4.3. Attacking the Vessel Walls: Clotting and Leaky Vessels While all vaccines seek to stimulate an immune response, not all immune responses are created equal. Some are safe and well-modulated whereas others can be misdirected and out of control. Immune responses are problematic when they attack the self, as in autoimmune conditions, and/or when they are excessively intense and severe. COVID-19 vaccines incur problematic immunity in both key ways. First, they can be expected mobilise a self-to-self immune response against the endothelial cells lining blood vessel walls. Second, by boosting SARS-CoV-2 immunity, they can be expected to incite an increasingly aggressive response with each administration of the vaccine. To understand the realities of these processes it is necessary to first understand the basics of the underlying immune response. There are three key components of the immune system relevant to risks from COVID- 19 vaccines: T-cells, antibodies and the complement cascade."

    "text": "2.4.3.1. T-cells Once the body’s cells have been infected with a virus, immune cells known as cytotoxic T-cells or T-killer cells attack and destroy the infected cells. This prevents infected cells from replicating the virus and spreading the infection throughout the body. After the initial battle with a certain pathogen is over, some of the specifically adapted T-cells enter a state of dormancy to become memory T-cells. In case the same virus is encountered again, these dormant T-cells can be swiftly reawakened and propagated to mount a faster and more vigorous response next time. Known as a secondary or memory-type response, it will also occur with viruses that are not exactly the same as the one initially encountered but sufficiently similar to be recognised. This latter phenomenon is referred to as cross-immunity. It has been known since mid 2020 that we are protected against SARS-CoV-2 by cross-reactive memory T-cells [7–11]. As with antibodies, this is based on previous encounters with common cold coronaviruses, and with the SARS virus in a small number of people. Such prior experience has been found to confer “robust” [7] and lasting T-cell cross-immunity to COVID-19. T-cell memory for the SARS virus is known to last at least 17 years [7], but it likely lasts a lifetime."

    "text": "2.4.3.2. Antibodies Before the new discoveries of 2021, scientists’ concerns about clotting and bleeding were based primarily on the prediction that killer T-cells would attack spike-producing endothelial cells, causing lesions on  vessel linings and promoting blood clots. While this mechanism remains valid, we now know that a memory-type antibody response will join the attack on the vessel walls as well. Whereas killer T-cells attack their targets cell-to-cell, antibodies are proteins that exert their effect by binding to signature structures on the pathogen’s surface, known as epitopes. Instead of destroying cells directly, once attached to an epitope, antibodies help to defeat invaders by “calling out the cavalry” on infected cells. This leads to the second process by which cells coated with viral spikes will inadvertently come under immune attack. “Calling out the cavalry” means that the antibodies attached to the unnaturally created spikes will trigger activation of the complement system, which thereupon will mount a massive attack on the endothelial cells. Importantly for deciphering the recent discoveries on SARS-CoV-2 immunity, the first time that the immune system encounters a new pathogen, new antibodies in a shape capable of binding to that pathogen’s epitopes must be formed (by immune cells known as B-cells). First-time antibody production is slow, taking approximately four weeks. Should the same pathogen or family of pathogens invade again, however, memory-type antibodies are then manufactured more rapidly, within one to two weeks. This is a cardinal sign that the immune system has seen that pathogen before. Another defining feature of a memory antibody response concerns the order in which antibody sub-types are produced. If a pathogen is new, IgM is the first type of antibody to arrive on the scene. It is followed later by IgG and IgA. The next time the pathogen arrives, however, IgG and IgA will be the first to arrive, indicating that the virus, or its relatives, have invaded before. Importantly, this is precisely what we see with COVID-19. Several research groups found in 2021 that upon first exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and following COVID-19 vaccination, the antibody response was characteristic of the memory type, due both to the timing and nature of antibodies measured. [xv-xvii] As a result, we now know that our immune systems recognise SARS-CoV-2 at first sight, even “on the slightest viral challenge” [5]. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 is not a novel coronavirus after all. With respect to variants and the need for booster shots, memory B-cells, like memory T-cells, can recognise not only a specific virus, but a whole family of viruses bearing related epitopes. It is unsurprising, therefore, that memory B-cells recognise SARS-CoV-2 from the common cold. With cross immunity this robust, closer relatives of SARS-CoV-2 in the form of variants will pose no obstacle to our antibody response. The rising “cases”, hospitalisations and deaths attributed to Delta and other variants are therefore almost certainly driven by false positive PCR results and misclassification than by a true increase in COVID-19 disease. Indeed, according to Public Health England data, the Delta variant is non- lethal in those under 50, and less than half as lethal as earlier strains in older age groups [26]. But why haven’t circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 been detected in populations before? The answer is that neither the antibodies nor T-cells associated with a memory-type response circulate in the bloodstream. Once they are no longer needed, they become dormant, existing as a memory alone. Unless elicited by re-exposure to a virus, they remain invisible in the bloodstream. The dormant antibodies will, however, be ready and waiting to re-activate and call out the cavalry on the spike protein, in the form of the complement cascade."

    "text": "2.4.3.3. Complement Recent findings indicate that complement activation is a serious concern with respect to COVID-19 vaccine-immune interactions. In light of the newly characterised antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, when antibodies attach to spike- producing endothelial cells on vessel walls following vaccine administration, activated complement proteins can be expected attach to the endothelial cells, and perforate their cell membranes [27,28]. The ensuing death of the endothelial cells will expose the tissue underneath the epithelium, which will initiate two significant events. It will induce blood clotting, and will cause the vessel walls to leak [6]. This pathogenic mechanism has been documented in biopsies taken from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients [19,29]. Those studies have described a “catastrophic microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of complement” [29] as part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immune response. It is precisely this immune response that COVID-19 vaccines seek to induce. Such vaccine-immune interactions are consistent with adverse events involving visible capillary rupture under the skin that have been documented and reported following COVID-19 vaccination [30–33]."

    "text": "2.4.3.4. Leaky Vessels—The Promise of Booster Shots Given that booster shots repeatedly boost the immune response to the spike protein, they will progressively boost self-to-self immune attack, including boosting complement-mediated damage to vessel walls. Clinically speaking, the greater the vessel leakage and clotting that subsequently occurs, the more likely that organs supplied by the affected blood flow will sustain damage. From stroke to heart attack to brain vein thrombosis, the symptoms can range from death to headaches, nausea and vomiting, all of which heavily populate adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines [2]. As well as damage from leakage and clotting alone, it is additionally possible that the vaccine itself may leak into surrounding organs and tissues. Should this take place, the cells of those organs will themselves begin to produce spike protein, and will come under attack in the same way as the vessel walls. Damage to major organs such as the lungs, ovaries, placenta and heart can be expected ensue, with increasing severity and frequency as booster shots are rolled out."

Enhancing the Severity of Wild Coronavirus Infection Finally, as with the Dengue virus and several other viruses [34], antibodies to coronaviruses can ultimately aggravate rather than mitigate illness. This is called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. The underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated but it is already clear that the net effects are severely detrimental. Attempts to develop vaccines to the original SARS virus, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, repeatedly failed due to antibody-dependent enhancement of disease [35–37]. The vaccines induced antibodies, but when the vaccinated animals were subsequently infected with the wild-type virus, they became more ill than the unvaccinated animals, in some cases mortally so [38]."

    "text": "Implications for Doctors and Patients     Although vaccine manufacturers and regulators are aware of the risks of antibody enhancement of disease, this possibility was not adequately addressed in the clinical trials on any of the COVID-19 vaccines. The  FDA noted that Pfizer, “identified vaccine-associated enhanced disease, including vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease, as an important potential risk” [23]. The EMA similarly acknowledged that “vaccine associated enhanced respiratory disease” was “an important potential risk… that may be specific to vaccination for COVID- 19”. Why neither regulator sought to exclude such dangers prior to emergency use authorisation is an open question that all doctors and patients are entitled to ask. Why medical regulators failed to investigate the finding that large vaccine particles cross blood vessel walls, entering the bloodstream and posing risks of blood clotting and leaky vessels is yet another open question again. The fact that vaccine rollout began before the immune profile of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccines had been adequately delineated is symptomatic of a rushed and highly politicised approach to the approval and regulation of COVID-19 vaccines. As is the lack of clinical trials investigating the safety of COVID- 19 booster shots. In this context, it is up to doctors and patients to uphold the social contract of the doctor-patient relationship, and take medical prudence and patient safety into their own hands. The World Medical Association, Declaration of Geneva, Physician’s Pledge states [39]: “The health and wellbeing of my patient will be my first consideration. I will maintain the utmost respect for human life. I will practise my profession with conscience and dignity and in accordance with good medical practice. I will respect the autonomy and dignity of my patient. I will not use my medical knowledge to violate human rights and civil liberties, even under threat.”"

Whilst he understands that many people want to do what’s best to stop the virus, he also understands there are those who do not wish to lose their life as a result.  “And that’s what they’re being asked for; they’re being asked to … take a vaccine, and even though it’s rare, you could lose your life and then people are saying, ‘Well, how rare is rare?’ and I can just tell you, the mortality rate by all expert analyses is unacceptably high,” McCullough said."

    "text": "    CLS is an extremely rare, serious condition that causes fluid to leak from small blood vessels (capillaries), causing rapid swelling of the arms and legs, sudden weight gain, feeling faint, thickening of the blood, low levels of albumin in the blood (an important blood protein) and low blood pressure. CLS is commonly associated with viral infections, some blood cancers, inflammatory diseases, and some treatments.  CLS is already a known side effect of the AstraZeneca vector vaccine. The EMA examined 11 reported cases of CLS after the Spikevax vaccination and 44 cases that occurred after the Comirnaty (Pfizer for BioNTech) shot. With Comirnaty more frequently used, its incidence rate occurred at a lower ratio. As a result, regulators concluded that only Spikevax required a warning of the disease. In addition, the regulators also claim there to be insufficient evidence to attribute these new CLS cases to the vaccines. Instead, they assert the Covid shot would likely only cause a resurgence of the disease."

I don’t think the world can wait for a classical vaccine.” But when asked if she would take the vaccine right away, she responded: “I won’t be taking it immediately – probably not for at least the coming year,” she told the Post. “We have to wait and see whether it really works.” "

    "text": "However, these vaccines may not be right for everyone. The CDC advises that certain people not get specific vaccines, or to wait before getting vaccinated. This is because different vaccines contain different components, and each vaccine can affect you differently. Your age, health conditions, and other factors all combine to determine if you should get each vaccine.  The CDC has prepared a detailed list of vaccinesTrusted Source that specifies who should avoid getting each one and who should wait to get it. Certain individuals with a compromised immune system are typically advised to wait. And people who have experienced allergic reactions to a particular vaccine are generally told to avoid follow-up doses."

By signing this statement of support, health care experts are sending a message: Get children vaccinated and contact your health care provider to answer vaccine questions as soon as you can.  The 236 physicians and health care providers represent 17 different Nebraska communities. They have joined forces as part of the Max the Vax initiative, an effort to maximize vaccination rates among children to keep Nebraska kids protected, healthy and in school. The effort is led by the Nebraska Department of Education and Children’s Hospital & Medical Center."

    "text": "“We're seeing a trend; kids who are not yet vaccinated are getting COVID-19 and becoming severely ill and hospitalized,” said Kari Simonsen, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and pediatrician-in-chief at Children's Hospital & Medical Center. “Vaccinating kids against COVID-19 benefits our whole community because there will be fewer illnesses in children and fewer illnesses in the adults that they are around.”  While case numbers have continued to fluctuate, previous spikes of COVID-19 cases have caused disruptions in care for individuals with non-COVID-19 health needs. As more families become vaccinated against COVID-19 to prevent severe illness, it alleviates strain on community health care systems.  “If I didn't believe in the vaccine, I wouldn't have gotten it for my children. It reduces the spread of COVID-19 and the risk of severe symptoms. It also is safe for children. There has been plenty of research on it in the last two years,” said Anna Warnes, APRN, who serves as a family medical practitioner in Crete and Wilber, Nebraska."

She wants to be clear — immunity after a COVID-19 infection and the body's natural immunity are not enough to fight the virus and its emerging variants. Dr-Stoolman-at-Press-Conference.jpg  Sharon Stoolman, M.D., pediatric physician at Children's Hospital & Medical Center, shares facts on the importance of COVID-19 vaccination for kids. Photo provided by MaxtheVaxNE.org  “I'd equate it to your protection in a hurricane. If we were in a regular rainstorm, your natural immunity might be enough of an umbrella for you to weather the storm. But in a pandemic with large amounts of the virus in the community, we need more than just an umbrella. We're going to need a poncho, rain pants and boots because the natural immunity you have could not be enough for the latest variant. So, we are urging families to get vaccinated even if you had COVID-19 last year because we need that added layer of protection,” Dr. Stoolman said. "

    "text": "Health care providers are the absolute best source for health information  “When folks are hesitant about getting the vaccine, the first thing I recommend is to talk to a trusted health care provider who knows them best. Those questions and concerns are usually very personal and related to individual health conditions,” said Dr. Simonsen. “I want people to talk with a health provider that knows them well. But I also encourage everyone to ask those questions and go forward with getting the vaccine. It's safe. It's been delivered to millions in the U.S. at this point, including millions of kids, and we need to get more of our kids vaccinated to help get through this pandemic.”  Research on the COVID-19 vaccine began in 2003 thanks to the SARS virus, COVID-19's cousin. The process used to develop the vaccine in 2020 was previously designed to make and test vaccines quickly in case of an infectious disease pandemic.  “We have a long history of vaccinating kids to keep them healthy — from polio to measles and pertussis. As physicians, we know vaccine safety. We know the long-term side effects, short-term side effects and what to expect,” said Dr. Stoolman.  “We understand that the vaccine can cause anxiety. That is why we're working to provide resources, support and education for families with questions and concerns. We are here for you,” said Emily Braun, M.D., with OneWorld Community Health Centers."

It remains an urgent to-do for those who are eligible for the vaccine,” said Chanda Chacón, MPH, FACHE, Children's president and CEO.  Health care providers say getting vaccinated is the best thing families can do right now to play a part in bringing life back to a type of normalcy after over two years of disruption and uncertainty.  “So many things were not given a second thought two years ago, like going to a basketball game or a music concert, visiting grandparents, going to school and feeling safe. Now every little decision we make in our children's lives, every little experience they have is altered by COVID-19,” said Warnes. “Having kids vaccinated benefits our communities in that it allows us the freedom to thrive again. It allows for the activities we had before. Businesses and schools can stay open. The vaccine is a gateway to freedom for our communities and for those who are vaccinated.”"

Or at least a new normal.”  Lichtenberg says it’s important that any new vaccine be fairly priced, but also that it is financially attractive for companies to invest heavily in research.  “Given how valuable this would be to the world, providing financial incentives to industry is important,” Lichtenberg says. “We need to develop a safe and effective vaccine as quickly as possible.”"
