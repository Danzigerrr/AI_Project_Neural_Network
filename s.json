The vaccines, offered to the U.S. population, have proved to be 90 percent effective against infection. Ready within a year of the outbreak, they have proved to be safe. And they are widely available and free. There is no parallel in modern times. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 eligible Americans have yet to get their first vaccine dose. Millions of people remain unvaccinated. They were 14 times more likely than the vaccinated to die of covid, as of December, the latest month for which data is available. How many of the 551,168 covid deaths in the United States since Jan. 1, 2021, could have been averted with vaccines? Too many. No more powerful case can be made than the voices of those who hesitated to get vaccinated and then faced the awful consequences."

Within days, mRNA coronavirus vaccines were being widely acknowledged as one of our best bets against the virus. Scientists started using the technology to develop shots — on a breathtakingly rapid timeline. Suddenly, it seemed, everyone wanted to know who was responsible for this promising technique. If Malone is right about one thing pertaining to the mRNA vaccines, Geall said, it's that it is still important to keep researching these products and answering any yet unanswered questions about them, in addition to improving how and when they're used. \"Would I have preferred that there had been 15 years of research and safety generation through clinical trials? Absolutely,\" Geall said. \"But that wasn't an option during the pandemic.\" So he, and all the other scientists interviewed for this article, got vaccinated with the mRNA vaccines that they, Malone, and many others helped create over a 30-year period."

The response may be similar whether that first encounter is from infection with the virus or from the first dose of the vaccine. Studies of the mRNA vaccines suggest that one dose may offer between 50 to 80 percent protection against symptomatic COVID-19, though more data is needed, said Boslett. “We know you get some amount of protection after one dose of the vaccine or after infection with the virus, but we don’t know in either case how long that protection lasts,” she said. Some cases of reinfection have been reported after three to six months, so the protection from one dose of the vaccine also may wane in that timeframe. “However, when you get the second dose of the vaccine, you’re further training your immune system,” said Boslett. “You’re strengthening that response from the antibody-producing B cells and you’re also activating T memory cells that stick around for much longer.” Getting both doses of the vaccine means your body is shown this spike protein multiple times in a short duration. “So that immune response might be bigger, better and longer lasting than just getting the infection one time,” she said. Because the booster effect is so important, Boslett adds that this is why people who have had COVID-19 are still recommended to get the vaccine. "

The COVID-19 vaccine trials have moved along faster thanks to extra financial support from the government and other funding sources, and the high prevalence of the virus in the community, said Boslett. “They didn’t skip any steps.” More than 40,000 people were enrolled in the Pfizer vaccine trials, and more than 30,000 in the Moderna vaccine trials. “That’s a lot of people, but if the virus were rare, that still wouldn’t be enough people,” said Boslett. “But because the virus is running so rampant throughout the U.S. and other places in the world, this was actually a good number of people to show a difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.” The mRNA technology, which has undergone years of study for other potential vaccines, was another time-saver.

Once the study is complete, the numbers of sick people in each group are compared, in order to calculate the relative risk of getting sick depending on whether or not the subjects received the vaccine. From this we get the efficacy – a measure of how much the vaccine lowered the risk of getting sick. If a vaccine has high efficacy, a lot fewer people in the group who received the vaccine got sick than the people in the group who received the placebo. So, for example, let’s imagine a vaccine with a proven efficacy of 80%. This means that – out of the people in the clinical trial – those who received the vaccine were at a 80% lower risk of developing disease  than the group who received the placebo. This is calculated by comparing the number of cases of disease in the vaccinated group versus the placebo group. An efficacy of 80% does not mean that 20% of the vaccinated group will become ill."

Many epidemiological vaccine safety studies make the basic mistake of declaring \"lack of association\" because the confidence interval of the odds ratio does not span the null value.

    "text": "Since the Covid-19 vaccines have been released under the emergency use authorization act (EUA) as an experimental, and mostly untested, set of vaccines, we have seen a dramatic rise in reported deaths and serious injuries caused by these “vaccines”. In fact, since VAERS data was first released, deaths caused by the vaccines have increased by almost 1,000 deaths per month. The last figures, as of June 25th, 2021 recorded 9,049 Covid vaccine-related deaths, which is an increase of 2,000 deaths in just one week. This indicates that there has been a dramatic acceleration in vaccine-related deaths. Prior to these vaccines, deaths from all vaccines combined, per year were around 350 people. Despite the mass, unprecedented number of vaccine-related deaths, the program continued unabated. During this same period, 34,065 serious complications have also been reported secondary to these vaccines, up 2,825 cases within the previous week. VAERS reports that 5,852 of these people are permanently damaged. Over 54,551 people suffered such a significant reaction to the vaccines that they ended up in the emergency room. Of the injuries 6,898 were considered life threatening. If we even use a very low figure of underreporting of 10% (rather than the 99% true figure) that would mean we actually have 90,000 deaths and 340,000 serious injuries, 58,852 of whom are permanently injured. Steve Kirsch, a researcher, stated in a position paper that his examination, confirmed by three studies, concluded that possibly 25,800 Americans have died as a result of the vaccines. Because of poor record keeping, we just don’t have an accurate number yet."

However, the unvaccinated makeup only 27 percent of the caseload, 25 percent of hospitalizations, and roughly 10 percent of the deaths in England now. The United Kingdom is officially living in a pandemic of the “fully vaccinated.” To make matters worse, deaths continue to surge for populations that are triply vaccinated, proving that the third shot is not an immune booster in the slightest. This third shot is just another inflammatory dose of spike proteins – a game of Russian roulette that causes more blood clots and heart inflammation, leading to further immune system depletion, sickness and death. While the Week 8 report paints a harrowing picture of vaccine failure, vaccine damage and propaganda exposed, the report also states, “this raw data should not be used to estimate vaccine effectiveness.” In other words, the raw data should be ignored and the covid-19 vaccination narrative should still be blindly and arrogantly believed. According to the data, roughly 400,000 unvaccinated people tested positive for covid-19 and over one million VACCINATED people tested positive. A total of 752,126 of these cases were recorded in triply vaccinated individuals. This data is shocking because the unvaccinated are the ones who are typically coerced to take covid-19 PCR tests as a prerequisite to interact with the public. If the unvaccinated want to partake in certain public events and travel, they are more likely to be contact traced and forcibly swabbed as if they have no freedom or due process rights."

However, there were 6,889 hospitalizations for the vaccinated (a number that is rapidly increasing). Most of these hospitalizations are occurring in triply vaccinated individuals (4,936). In all, 75 percent of all Covid-19 hospitalizations are observed in the vaccinated. When it comes to fatalities, the unvaccinated cohort is improving. The unvaccinated accounted for 559 deaths in the last reporting period and the vaccinated accounted for 4,302 deaths, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the triply vaccinated (3,120). The vaccinated population now accounts for 90 percent of the deaths overall. The triply vaccinated account for 4 of every 5 of these fatalities! To put these figures in perspective, take a look at the Week 51 Vaccine Surveillance Report for 2021. From November 22 to December 19, 2021, there were 889 unvaccinated deaths and 2,913 vaccinated deaths. This shows that the fatality rate for the unvaccinated population is going down, while the fatality rate for the vaccinated population is getting severely worse.

It’s entitled, “Intracellular Reverse Transcription of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 In Vitro in Human Liver Cell Line.” The study concludes that, “BNT162b2 mRNA is reverse transcribed intracellularly into DNA as fast as 6 [hours] after BNT162b2 exposure.” This means the vaccine alters your genetic code in mere hours after being injected. This may help explain why cancer rates are exploding in people who take covid vaccines. The integrity of their DNA is being destroyed. It is also yet more proof that the mRNA particles from the vaccine do, indeed, circulate throughout the body and don’t stay restricted to the injection site. That’s another lie told to the world by the CDC, Big Tech and the pharma-funded corporate media which has been caught in lie after lie when it comes to covid origins and vaccine safety."

In 2020, Zelenko gained the attention of then-president Donald Trump with his simple protocol against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) using cheap, proven and widely available drugs that include hydroxychloroquine. He was able to successfully treat more than 350 patients with only one requiring hospitalization. His approach is to identify high-risk COVID patients and start treatment immediately. However, so-called public health experts were not convinced and questioned Zelenko’s protocol. Two years later, amidst the continued suppression of early treatments, Zelenko talked about a newly discovered adverse effect of COVID-19 vaccines: the vaccine-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or VAIDS. (Related: As covid injections spread autoimmune disease and “VAIDS,” media pivots to incoming AIDS “vaccine” that will only accelerate the vaccine genocide.) He shared that Israel, one of the most vaccinated countries in the world, may have put its citizens in danger. “There are 30 peer-reviewed papers that I know of that have documented how these vaccines destroy your innate immune system.

This report from VAERS, according to Ruby, was filed by the mom. The mother also said in the entry that her baby became very sick with a high fever about two weeks after she got her first COVID jab.

For example, phase three of the trial – when tens of thousands of trial participants were given the jab – commenced when phase two – which saw hundreds receiving the vaccine – was still ongoing. At a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday, Dr June Raine – the head of the UK’s regulatory agency which has given the Pfizer treatment the thumbs up – said no corners have been cut. “If you’re climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became available on 10 November we were at base camp,” she said. “And then when we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us to today.” Vaccine trials are usually held up by long periods of inertia – waiting for funding, resources and permissions to come through. But, because of the huge global stake in ending the pandemic, there was no waiting game.  A huge amount of funding and support were poured into vaccine efforts across the world – and that’s brought us to where we are today. As for side effects, they usually show up in trials quickly after vaccination – while longer-term effects are very rare. So you don’t have anything to worry about on that front, either."

    "text": "I just finished watching the “stop the mandate” march in DC. There were lots of people that have been harmed by this shot that have had their lives ruined by it. Over 20,000 adverse side effects and over 12,000 deaths and people still trust what they are being told by big pharma. When do we get our lives back? Millions have gotten the jab and according to the govt. we were supposed to be going back to normal if we complied. That didn’t happen. When do our doctors get to practice their profession and treat us with symptoms before we have to go to the hospital? I don’t want to be told to go home and come back when I can’t breathe. Time to have our rights restored, our doctors treating us and to make our own choices. This is still America. "

    "text": "Proponents of vaccine mandates typically claim that everyone who can be vaccinated has a moral or ethical obligation to do so for the sake of those who cannot be vaccinated, or in the interest of public health. I evaluate several previously undertheorised premises implicit to the ‘obligation to vaccinate’ type of arguments and show that the general conclusion is false: there is neither a moral obligation to vaccinate nor a sound ethical basis to mandate vaccination under any circumstances, even for hypothetical vaccines that are medically risk-free. Agent autonomy with respect to self-constitution has absolute normative priority over reduction or elimination of the associated risks to life. In practical terms, mandatory vaccination amounts to discrimination against healthy, innate biological characteristics, which goes against the established ethical norms and is also defeasible a priori."

    "text": "However, there has been a recent rise in anti-vaccination sentiments surrounding beliefs that vaccines cause more harm than benefits to the health of the children who receive them. The premise of the anti-vaccination movement can also be contributed to the demonization of vaccinations by news and entertainment outlets. Voices such as Jenny McCarthy’s have proven to be influential, sweeping fear and distrust into parents’ minds by parading as “autism experts”. Social media and television talk show hosts, such as Oprah Winfrey, played a big role in this miseducation by giving credence to the campaign. This has caused vaccination rates to sustain a surprising drop in some Western countries [2]. The decrease in vaccinations has led to recent outbreaks of diseases that were thought to be “eliminated”, such as measles. Still, other reasons for the anti-vaccination movement can be due to personal reasons, such as religious or secular views. A drop in immunizations poses a threat to the herd immunity the medical world has worked hard to achieve. Global communities are now more connected than ever, which translates to a higher probability of the transmission of pathogens. The only thing that can protect populations against a rapidly spreading disease is the disease's resistance created by herd immunity when the majority are immune after vaccinations. Given the highly contagious nature of diseases like measles, vaccination rates of 96% to 99% are necessary to preserve herd immunity and prevent future outbreaks [3]."

Some vaccines cause a temporary headache, fatigue or loss of appetite. Rarely, a child might experience a severe allergic reaction or a neurological side effect, such as a seizure. Although these rare side effects are a concern, the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm or death is extremely small. The benefits of getting a vaccine are much greater than the possible side effects for almost all children."

Some cite religious beliefs as the reason behind their refusal to get vaccinated, though most mainstream religions do not condemn vaccines. There was a belief that diseases were disappearing due to better sanitation and hygiene, not vaccines. This has been proven false by the resurgence of previously eradicated infectious diseases. It was also believed that a vaccine wouldn’t protect you.Those who are vaccinated can still get sick, but they will experience mild symptoms. People also think the risks outweigh the benefits. This is currently the biggest objection in the United States. Parents cite many medical risks, including autism, as potential consequences of being vaccinated.There is the common belief that since these diseases have been eliminated, there’s no need for vaccinations. Diseases will only stay eradicated as long as vaccines are still used to prevent them. And many think that pharmaceutical companies can’t be trusted. They believe that pharmaceutical companies only want to sell their products, regardless of the impact on the people who use them."

Some people believe that pharmaceutical companies and scientists want to sell a product regardless of harmful consequences. Others are skeptical of science that they don’t understand, or the chemicals they don’t know that go into vaccines. This distrust grows, as laws require children to be vaccinated in order to attend public schools. Some parents prefer “natural” or homeopathic treatments instead. These treatments can aid in relieving the symptoms of some conditions, but are not as effective in preventing disease. When people mistrust science, they’re less likely to vaccinate. They’re also less likely to trust the doctors who recommend vaccines."
